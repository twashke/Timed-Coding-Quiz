## About the Project

- This project was built to create a timed coding quiz to test the user's knowledge of Javascript.
- The motiviation for this project was to utilize Javascript skills to create an interactive quiz that is timed.  
- Once the user press starts, the rules to the game are displayed.
- When the alert is closed, the timer begins and the first question is displayed for the user.
- Any wrong answer results in ten seconds being deducted from the clock.
- If zero questions are answered correctly, or the time runs out, the user loses and no high scores are recorded.
- The final score is the amount of time left on the clock when the quiz is finished.
- The amount of correct questions answered will be displayed at the end before a high score can be entered.
- The high scores are logged and sorted highest to lowest, the user can clear the high score list at anytime.
- Comments have been added to Javascript to clarify each step and make future updates easier.
